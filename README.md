This is my CSP Project. I made a password tracker in python that is able to store all passwords under one account. The program allows
the user to make their own account unique to them protected by a password. Once logged in, the user is able to store passwords by 
purpose. They are able to add, delete, list all passwords and search for password based on purpose. Once they are done, the user is
able to log out.
